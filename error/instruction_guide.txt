PROJECT: Old Money – MAIN INSTRUCTION GUIDE
FORMAT: Single entry point for all instructions

=============================================================
PURPOSE
=============================================================
This is the MAIN instruction file. Start here every time.
Do NOT start with any other .txt file.

=============================================================
HOW TO USE (READ ORDER)
=============================================================
1) instruction_guide.txt (THIS FILE) — Decide what you are doing.
2) Then read the specific file for the task:
   - html_structure_guide.txt  → Building/structuring HTML pages
   - color_palette_guide.txt   → Color selection and usage
   - buttons_guide.txt         → Button types, sizes, icons
   - TOOLTIP_REQUIREMENT.txt   → Tooltip rules for buttons
3) Use design_style_guide.txt for the full consolidated implementation details.
4) Use general_ui_standards.txt only for broad principles and extra standards.
5) Use abbreviation_guide.txt for command behavior (only command-instruction file).

=============================================================
