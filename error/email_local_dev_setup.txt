Local Email Function Setup (Netlify)

1) Install Netlify CLI (one-time):
   npm install -g netlify-cli

2) Copy .env.example to .env and fill in values:
   - SENDGRID_API_KEY
   - SENDGRID_FROM

3) Run local dev server in this folder:
   netlify dev

4) The email endpoint will be:
   http://localhost:8888/.netlify/functions/send-email

Notes:
- SENDGRID_FROM must be a verified sender in SendGrid.
- If you are not using Netlify, you need another serverless host.
