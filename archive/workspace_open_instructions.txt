INSTRUCTIONS: Open Workspace + Next Steps

Why I asked:
- I need the project folder opened as the VS Code workspace to edit files safely.
- Without the workspace, I can’t read or change the files.

What I need you to do (once):
1) Close any untitled editor tabs.
2) In VS Code, click: File -> Open Folder...
3) Choose this folder: C:\Git\oldmoney
4) Click Open Folder (this opens the workspace).

If a Save dialog appears:
- Cancel it.
- Make sure no untitled tabs are open.
- Try File -> Open Folder... again.

After the folder opens, tell me “workspace opened”.

Then I will:
- Implement the modern email sending option (serverless function + SendGrid) you approved.
- Remove external links if still desired.
